This directory contains key source files for the CUP runtime library.
They may be useful for understanding more about how CUP and JFlex
represent tokens (symbols) and how the CUP parser works.  In
particular, if you want to do more sophisticated error handling or
other operations during parsing you may find it useful to override
some of the parser functions.

The full CUP sources can be obtained from the CUP website (see links
on the course project page).
